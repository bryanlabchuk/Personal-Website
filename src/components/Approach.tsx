            I’ve worked with high-profile clients—creators, executives, and
            households with significant public exposure. Those engagements stay
            confidential.

            I work discreetly. No testimonials from clients who value privacy.
            No case studies that could identify anyone. Initial conversations
            are confidential, and I don’t discuss client work publicly.
